I’ve walked through the setup of a Docker based Webhost management tool called Caprover. 
If you haven’t you can check those videos out on my channel and I’ve linked them in the description below and cards above.

One of the viewers commented on how to update PHP settings on the Docker based WordPress site, specifically how to increase the PHP File Upload limit. 
I realized I didn’t really cover this in the original videos and likely is an important piece for any WordPress developer so in this video I’ll show you
how to access the WordPress file system and make any changes you need to do for your WordPress site.
